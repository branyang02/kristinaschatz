# **GrondBros: Homemade Ice Cream Created By Sisters**

My sisters and I making ice cream during my junior year of high school when stuck at home during the COVID pandemic. Together, we started with simple vanilla and chocolate flavors. After we honed our skills, we started to dream of flavors beyond the instruction manual. Now, we experience with our ambitious ideas and love to share our frozen creations with friends. This blog is dedication to showing off our fresh batches! Stay tuned for updates coming soon.

## **Cinnamon Roll Ice Cream**

Who imagined that ice cream could taste this good? We're talking cinnamon rolls.

### The backstory

My younger sister and I were making a fresh batch of cinnamon rolls when we were struck with inspiration: what if we made cinnamon roll ice cream? We promptly got to work preparing a creamy, vanilla base and began the churn. We saved a few cinnamon rolls from our batch (it took a lot of will-power to not eat them all...), and we crumbled the fresh rolls into the churning mixture. After the ice cream thickened, we topped it with ground cinnamon and enjoyed. The creamy delight was even better than we expected, as the vanilla base soaked up lots of cinnamon roll flavor. We look forward to revisitng this flavor again soon in the future!

## **Blueberry Cheesecake**

Our blueberry cheesecake takes flavor in a totally new direction from our previous cinnamon roll batch.

### The backstory

Every morning, my sister routinely eats a hefty bowl of plain greek yogurt topped with frozen blueberries. She drizzles honey on top to perfect her most important meal of the day. This ritual of hers inspired our blueberry cheesecake flavor. Originally, we were simply going to create a blueberry batch. But as we poured the frozen blueberries into the mixture, we suddenly decided to take a more ambitious direction and add greek yogurt! We weren't sure if it would turn out well, but it ended up being the perfect flavor combination! Our blueberry cheesecake ice cream is the perfect balance of sweet and tart, creamy and fruity! We will definitely revisit this flavor in the future.
